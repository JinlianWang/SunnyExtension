# SunnyExtension

This repo is my playground for Chrome Extension. The initial code is based on [How to Make a Chrome Extension](https://thoughtbot.com/blog/how-to-make-a-chrome-extension). I will continue to add more code to explore other aspects, including: 

1) How to display a extension interface;
2) How to pass more data between extension and web page; 
3) How to copy and paste content between extension and web page; 
4) How to drag and drop data between extension and web page.
